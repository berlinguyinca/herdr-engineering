# Micro-spec 05: Build identity and safe maintenance

## Objective
Add durable bounded build registration, idempotent attempts, owner leases and cleanup fencing while retaining host flock. Never evict active worktrees; no source/worktree/toolchain deletion.

## Scope
Limit edits to the minimum existing module(s) found in audit. Do not create a second orchestrator or dashboard. If an external dependency/repository is absent, document blocker and complete self-contained portions safely. For remote or destructive operations, require explicit operator authorization.

## Required workflow
1. Read `AUDIT.md`, architecture, contracts and prior `HANDOFF.md`. Re-check files touched for drift and local user changes.
2. Write a 5–12 line implementation plan with concrete file paths and tests.
3. Write failing focused tests; implement only this unit; run focused and relevant regression tests.
4. Produce evidence (commands, exit codes, code revision, test counts, before/after measurements if relevant).
5. Add `HANDOFF.md` with completed/not-done/known risks, exact files, next micro-spec 06-fabric.

## Exit criteria
Crash/restart plus cleanup race tests and original gate tests.

## Stop conditions
Insufficient auth, unavailable toolchain/backend, unsupported upstream feature, dirty conflicting file, unverified remote host, failed correctness test, or unresolved safety hazard. Do not work around by deploying alternative infrastructure silently.
